# 📈 Stacked-LSTM-Stock-Predictor

## Overview

### This project implements a stacked LSTM deep learning model to forecast stock prices using historical time-series market data. The model learns sequential price patterns to predict future stock movements and evaluate forecasting reliability.

## Features

#### - Time-series stock price prediction
#### - Stacked LSTM neural network architecture
#### - Trend pattern learning from historical data
#### - Model performance evaluation using forecasting metrics

## Tech Stack

#### • Python 
#### • TensorFlow/Keras 
#### • NumPy 
#### • Pandas 
#### • Matplotlib

## Dataset

#### Stock price dataset (AAPL) containing historical market values such as open, close, high, low, and volume.

## Objective

#### To explore how deep learning models can capture temporal market patterns and assess their effectiveness for financial forecasting.

## Results

#### The model successfully learned price trends and demonstrated predictive capability on unseen data, highlighting both potential and limitations of deep learning in real market prediction.
